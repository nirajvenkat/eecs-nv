# EECS 6.002x 

Here are my notes for the course series: [Circuits and Electronics](https://www.edx.org/xseries/mitx-circuits-and-electronics), offered by MITx.

Instructor: [Anant Agarwal](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/anant-agarwal/)

A computational approach can be found for most problems. I use Mathematica to perform calculations and produce some interesting plots. Many problems have a guide, some helpful material that was in the comments section, textbook or lectures.

The notebooks are also converted to pdf, so one doesn't need a paid software license just to view the solutions. I used the export tool directly from within Mathematica, so this explains any artifacts (images that are truncated at pdf page boundaries, etc).
